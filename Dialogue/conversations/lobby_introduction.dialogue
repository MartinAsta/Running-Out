TIME: I AM TIME ITSELF.
TIME: AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED, THE FLOW OF TIME IS BEING PUT TO AN END THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
TIME: I AM LOSING MY GRASP OF IT, FOR EVEN A GOD IS SUBJECT TO ENTROPY, AND HIS MIND TO EROSION.
TIME: I CHOSE AN HEIR TO REPLACE ME IN THE RULING OF TIME... BUT MY CHOICE CLEARLY DISPLEASED SOME OF MY OFFSPRING.
TIME: UNFORTUNATELY, INTERVENING DIRECTLY IS FORBIDDEN BY THE LAWS OF GODHOOD.
TIME: HENCE WHY I RAN THROUGH THE FABRIC OF TIME, SEEKING SOMEONE CAPABLE OF DOING IT IN MY STEAD.
TIME: AND THAT IS WHY I SUMMONED YOU HERE.
TIME: TAKE THIS.
Martin: Sand ?
TIME: A FRAGMENT OF MY DECAYING BODY. YOU CAN DRAW POWER FROM IT.
TIME: YOU WILL INEVITABLY FIND MORE OF IT IN YOUR ATTEMPTS. BRING IT BACK TO ME AND I WILL MAKE YOU MORE POWERFUL.
You received a fistful of sand. It immediately seems to sink into the pores of your hand.
TIME: NOW GO. I WILL BRING YOU BACK HERE EVERYTIME YOU FAIL... UNTIL YOU DON'T.
You can now dash using Shift (keyboard) or B (Xbox controller)
